# SatelliteImagesSegmentation_Unet

Computer Vision Project, NYU Fall 2022

In this project, we implemented  multiple U-Net models to perform semantic segmentation of
landcover from satellite images. Landcover.ai dataset was used to train three different U-Net
models with different encoders to generate segmentation masks. We also performed
data augmentation using various transforms to improve on classification accuracy and reduce
overfitting. The performance of the trained models were evaluated and compared using various
metrics such as Jaccard Index, Precision, Recall, F1 Score and Exact Match Ratio.
